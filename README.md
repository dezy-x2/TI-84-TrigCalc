# TI-84-TrigCalc

Hey so this is a repository to hold my code that I have been programming my TI 84 with. These are mostly just for trigonometry so far.

### Description of each file

- **Quad Calc**: This file is mean to calculate the Quadrant that a certain radian is in.
  - The first prompt will ask for the amount of times around wich will be the numerator without the π. For instance in 3π/4 you would enter 3. The second prompt will ask for the degree wich in the case of 3π/4 would be 45˚
- **Short Quad Calc**: Same as the previous it just doesn't calculate the quadrant for you just the spin.
  - Same instructions as the last one.
- **Hello World TI**: This is just a hello world program.
  - No instructions.
- **Amp Calc**: Calculates the amplitude in a cosine or sine equation also known as the A value.
  - Just input the y-min and y-max when prompted
- **B Calc**: Calculates the B value for a cosine or sine equation
  - It will prompt you for the period
- **C Calc**: Calculates the C value for a cosine or sine equation
  - It will first prompt you for the phaseshift of the graph (make sure not to put it in terms of π just exclude it, the program will add it in itself). It will then ask for the B value. When it prints the C value it will put π back into it for you

Feel free to use any of these yourself. You will need the installer software on a computer of some kind. I used TI Connect CE. I used this because it is produced directly by TI themselves so it is easy to use and reliable. You can download it [here](https://education.ti.com/en/software/details/en/CA9C74CAD02440A69FDC7189D7E1B6C2/swticonnectcesoftware). If you want to learn TI Basic for youself I recommend [this](http://tibasicdev.wikidot.com/starter-kit) website.

# HAPPY CODING!
